# ET 5600 Project Group 3
**By Nadinne, Hailey, and Mimi for ET 5600**

## Setup Instructions 
(to start, you need to have python installed, as well as the pygame library)
1. Download the project as a .zip file
2. Extract the contents of the zip file (you only need the images folder and the Jump Journey python file). Move these 2 things to a folder of whatever name you want
3. On your preferred code runner (we used VS code) open the folder that you created with the images folder and the python file
4. Run the python file and have fun playing!
